          <p>
            I am a software developer seeking employment as a freelance web
            developer. I am a graduate of the Kentucky Community and Technical
            College System, where I earned a degree in Computer and Information
            Technology, with a focus on Software Development. I am currently
            located in Lexington Kentucky, where I own a home and live with my
            wife, THREE dogs, and our gorgeous baby girl.

          <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            I have experience in various web technologies, which I have acquired
            both in school, and through online resources I have studied on my
            own. Some of the skills I possess include: HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            I have also worked with frameworks such as Bootstrap, Vue and
            Vuetify. Additionally, I have built mobile applications for the
            Android platform using Android Studio and Java.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not working to improve my skills as programmer, I enjoy a
            number of hobbies. My favorite thing to do outside of coding is
            playing video games. My favorite game at the moment is a First
            Person Arena Shooter called Overwatch. I play this and most other
            games on my desktop computer, which I built custom. I enjoy taking
            apart computers and putting them back together, or building one from
            scratch. I also like to get outside and enjoy nice weather when I
            get the chance. I play a number of sports, especially softball with
            a group of friends throughout the year on the weekends. I also enjoy
            camping or hiking with my wife and my dogs!
