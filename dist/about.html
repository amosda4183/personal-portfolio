          <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
          <p>I have experience in various web technologies, which I have acquired both in school, and through online resources I have studied on my own. Some of the skills I possess include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sass and PHP. I have also worked with frameworks such as Bootstrap, Vue, Vuetify and jQuery. In addition, I have built mobile applications for the Android platform using Android Studio and Java. I am also working hard to learn enterprise frameworks such as Spring MVC for Java development, and ASP.NET.</p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>When I'm not working to improve my skills as programmer, I enjoy a number of hobbies. My favorite thing to do outside of coding is playing video games. My favorite game at the moment is a First Person Arena Shooter called Overwatch. I play this and most other games on my desktop computer, which I built from parts. I thoroughly enjoy taking apart computers and putting them back together, or building one from scratch. However, I like to get outside and enjoy nice weather when I get the chance. I enjoy playing a number of sports, especially softball with a group of friends on the weekends. I also enjoy camping or hiking with my wife and my dogs! </p>
